Google Tag Manager SDK for iOS Change Log

--------------------------------------------
Version: 3.01 (September, 2013)
--------------------------------------------
* Fixed link error when targeting iOS 7.0

--------------------------------------------
Version: 3.0 (August 16, 2013)
--------------------------------------------
* Added support for AdWords Conversion Tracking Tag, AdWords Remarketing Tag,
  and Custom Image Tag.

* Added Advertising Enabled Macro, Application ID Macro, and ID for
  Advertising Macro.

* Pushing a link to the data layer as "gtm.url" will now cache the
  Click Referrer for AdWords Tags.

* Updated cuteAnimals sample app to demonstrate how to use Function Call Macro
  and Function Call Tag.

--------------------------------------------
Version: 3.0b1 (July 26, 2013)
--------------------------------------------
* libGoogleAnalyticsServices.a replaces libTagManager.a in the
  downloaded SDK. libGoogleAnalyticsServices.a includes all functions
  in libTagManager.a plus version 3 of the Google Analytics SDK.
  Note that an application can't include both libGoogleAnalyticsServices.a
  and the old libGoogleAnalytics.a or libTagManager.a file.
  An application that wants to use GTM and also do analytics tracking should
  either update their GA calls to use version 3 of the SDK, or replace GA
  calls with data layer push calls and add appropriate rules to their
  container to fire Universal Analytics hits.

* Added Tag support in SDK. There are 2 types of tags currently supported:
  Universal Analytics (beta) tag and Custom Function Tag.

* Added DataLayer support to hold generic information about the application.
  An app can obtain the DataLayer object by calling TagManager::dataLayer.

* Added 2 new macros: data layer variable macro and custom event macro.

* Added LogLevel support into Logger. This allows adjusting the threshold of
  what gets logged without having to write a new logger.

* Added preview exit link support to allow exiting preview mode of a container
  without killing the app.

* Fixed a bug that prevented developers from using both GTM and open-sourced
  proto buffer library.

* Modified the cuteAnimals example to show how to instrument an application
  by pushing events to the data layer. A sample container is provided that
  uses the pushed events to fire Google Universal Analytics tag.

--------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0b3 (June 26, 2013)
--------------------------------------------
* TagManager::openContainer no longer allows opening multiple containers with
  the same container ID.

* ContainerOpener no longer has the two methods
  openNonDefaultContainerWithId:tagManager:timeout:notifier and
  openFreshContainerWithId:tagManager:timeout:notifier:.
  Instead, there are now two openContainer methods:
  openContainerWithId:tagManager:openType:timeout: and
  openContainerWithId:tagManager:openType:timeout:notifier.
  The first returns a TAGContainerFuture, while the other takes a notifier.
  Both of these methods take a parameter specifying how the container should
  be opened (kTAGPreferNonDefault or kTAGPreferFresh).  This should reduce
  confusion as to how TAGContainerFutures and notifiers interact.

  These two new methods can be called more than once with the same
  container ID; if the container is already open, it'll be returned (via the
  future or notifier).

* In container preview mode, containers that are already open will be
  auto-updated (was just updating the container on the next open).

--------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0b2 (June 3, 2013)
--------------------------------------------
* Initial beta release.

--------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0b1
--------------------------------------------
* Unreleased internal version.
